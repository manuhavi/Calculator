This project is a .NET 9 Web API backend for a GenAI deployment platform. Key features include:
- Bulk deployment orchestration (AI-driven)
- Predictive quality gates (AI code review, test generation)
- Monitoring and cost optimization endpoints
- Security: SSO, RBAC, audit logging

Follow best practices for security, compliance, and explainable AI. All AI decisions must be logged and auditable. Sensitive data must not be sent to external APIs unless explicitly allowed.
